        <h2>Patton Quotes</h2>
        <ul id="quotes">
          <li>A good plan violently executed right now is far better than a perfect plan executed next week.</li>
          <li>It is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died. Rather we should thank God that such men lived.</li>
          <li>Never tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.</li>
          <li>If everyone is thinking alike, then somebody isn't thinking.</li>
          <li>We herd sheep, we drive cattle, we lead people. Lead me, follow me, or get out of my way.</li>
          <li>If a man does his best, what else is there?</li>
          <li>Success is how high you bounce when you hit bottom.</li>
          <li>A pint of sweat will save a gallon of blood.</li>
          <li>Courage is fear holding on a minute longer.</li>
        </ul>
