# JavaScript Intermediate Algorithm Scripting

These are my solutions to the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting challenges from freeCodeCamp. They are here for reference and for me to refactor them later on as I deem necessary. Please do not use these to cheat instead solving the challenges for yourself. Remember Read, Search, Ask, and do your own work.
